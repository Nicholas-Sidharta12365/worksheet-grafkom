Overall, everybody contributed on every single type of task, so we technically learned everything. We've implemented quite a lot of bonus stuff, such as the multi-polygon, which can create infinite types of shapes (infinite bonuses hehehe), also a parallelogram and a pentagon. Besides that, we also created a spin counter clockwise option for bonus stuff.
